# Eats
The Eats is the software automation of the current feeding system so as to make it scalable through enabling access to all people without having to incur extra cost. The solution will also serve as a central place where all meal information is stored both for people and vendors. Vendors can manage meals and view feedback. People can conveniently pre-order meals without the fear that a particular favorite meal is finished.
